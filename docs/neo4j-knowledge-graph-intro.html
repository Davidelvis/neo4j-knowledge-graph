<p>Note: The code described in this post is based on an example that I worked on with Roberto Pieraccini (<a href="http://robertopieraccini.com/home/">http://robertopieraccini.com/home/</a>) at Jibo, Inc. We used a similar example to test a knowledge-graph-enhanced dialog running on Jibo (as seen in the video referenced above)</p>
<p>Note: A nice tool for viewing and live-editing neo4j graphs is called Graph Editor and is available at <a href="http://wwlib.org/graph-editor/">http://wwlib.org/graph-editor/</a></p>

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>One way to enhance NLU-driven dialog interactions is to make use of a knowledge graph. This example uses a neo4j graph (database) to store and query a knowledge graph (kg) containing information about animals. This simple example kg represents the relationships between a robot, and handful of animals, a few animal types and a couple of humans.</p>
<p>This command-line version uses node-nlp by default and can be configured to use Microsoft&#39;s LUIS NLU. A neo4j graph database is also required (ideally an empty graph). Some setup is required to get started.</p>
<h4 id="setup">Setup</h4>
<p>1 - Clone and install the neo4j-knowledge-graph repo</p>
<pre><code>git clone git@github<span class="hljs-selector-class">.com</span>:wwlib/neo4j-knowledge-graph<span class="hljs-selector-class">.git</span>
cd  neo4j-knowledge-graph
yarn
</code></pre><p>The project looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="./img/neo4j-kg-tutorial-vscode.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<p>2 - NLU
(optional: create a LUIS NLU agent by uploading the included agent description file to your LUIS account:</p>
<ul>
<li>docs/luis-knowledge-graph.json</li>
</ul>
<p>See the NLU screenshots at the end of this post for descriptions of the LUIS agent.</p>
<p>3 - Neo4j
Download and install the free Neo4j Desktop app from <a href="https://neo4j.com/download-neo4j-now/">https://neo4j.com/download-neo4j-now/</a> and create a new graph.</p>
<p><img src="./img/neo4j-kg-tutorial-neo4j-desktop.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<p>Start the graph and access it in the browser at: <a href="http://localhost:7474/browser/">http://localhost:7474/browser/</a></p>
<p>To populate the graph, paste the contents of docs/animals.cypher into the neo4j browser query field. Then verify that the graph is ready by entering this cypher into the browser query field:</p>
<p><code>MATCH (n) return n limit 100</code></p>
<p>The result should look like the image below.</p>
<p><img src="./img/neo4j-kg-tutorial-neo4j-browser.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<p>To see just the animal relationships, enter this cypher into the browser query field:</p>
<p><code>match (n)-[r:IS_A]-(m) return n, r, m</code></p>
<p>The result should look like the image below</p>
<p><img src="./img/neo4j-kg-tutorial-animals-IS_A.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<p>4 - Configuring the neo4j-knowledge-graph command-line app</p>
<p>Copy <code>data/config-example.json</code> and rename it <code>data/config.json</code></p>
<p>Fill out the user and password fields for your neo4j graph. (optional: fill out the access credentials for your LUIS agent). </p>
<pre><code>{
   <span class="hljs-attr">"luis"</span>: {
        <span class="hljs-attr">"endpoint"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">""</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">"appId"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">""</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">"subscriptionKey"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">""</span>
    },
    <span class="hljs-attr">"neo4j"</span>: {
        <span class="hljs-attr">"url"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"bolt://localhost:7687"</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">"user"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"neo4j"</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">"password"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">""</span>
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Save the <code>data/config.json</code> file.</p>
<h4 id="running-the-command-line-app">Running the command line app</h4>
<p>In a terminal window, in the <code>neo4j-knowledge-graph</code> directory, build and run the command line app:</p>
<pre><code>yarn <span class="hljs-keyword">build
</span>yarn <span class="hljs-built_in">debug</span>
</code></pre><p>If everything is setup correctly, you should should be prompted with:</p>
<p><code>Ask a do-you-like question or say “[user] likes [something]”</code></p>
<p>Try asking (typing): <code>do you like penguins</code></p>
<p>The response should look like the screen below:</p>
<p><img src="./img/neo4j-kg-tutorial-doYouLike-penguins.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<p>The example graph contains a set of animal-related nodes and relationships that looks like this (as seen in Graph Editor):</p>
<p><img src="./img/graph-editor-animals-IS_A.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<p>The graph also contains nodes and relationship relating a robot and a couple of users to the animals:</p>
<p><img src="./img/neo4j-kg-tutorial-LIKES-cynthia-no-penguins.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<p>According to the graph, the robot likes Flies, Zebras, Whales, Armadillos, Flamingos, and Penguins. Andrew likes whales. Cynthia likes the robot. Asking, “do you like whales” produces the response below: “You know it. One of my favorite animals...and I know that Andrew likes them too.”</p>
<p>Note: In the Penguin node has a special RobotLikes property which is used in the response. A generic response is generated for nodes that do not have this property.</p>
<p><img src="./img/neo4j-kg-tutorial-doYouLike-whales.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<p>To answer the question, “Do you like bats”, the app must make an upward reference because the robot does not have a direct LIKES relationship to bats. The app checks the bat’s parent node, AnimalType (Mammal), and then responds with a list of mammals that the robot does like:</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I like bats, but they are Mammals and I do like Mammals. Of all the Mammals I like Armadillos, Zebras, and Whales.”</p>
<p><img src="./img/neo4j-kg-tutorial-doYouLike-bats.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<p><img src="./img/neo4j-kg-tutorial-mammals-LIKES.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<p>The graph can be modified by asserting that a user likes something. For example, asserting that “cynthia likes penguins” produces the result:</p>
<p>OK. I understand that cynthia likes penguins. That’s cool.</p>
<p><img src="./img/neo4j-kg-tutorial-userLikes-cynthia.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<p>Querying the graph now reveals that the fact that Cynthia likes penguins has been incorporated:</p>
<p><code>match (n)-[r:LIKES]-(m) return n, r, m</code></p>
<p><img src="./img/neo4j-kg-tutorial-LIKES-cynthia-penguins.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<p>Now, asking if the robot likes penguins produces a response that includes the new information about Cynthia:</p>
<p><img src="./img/neo4j-kg-tutorial-doYouLike-penguins-cynthia.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<p>When asking about an AnimalType, like ‘Animal’, the answer will include all of the descendants that are liked by the robot.</p>
<p><img src="./img/neo4j-kg-tutorial-doYouLike-animals.png" alt="neo4j-knowledge-graph"></p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>This simple example offers a quick way to incorporate a knowledge graph into a dialog interaction. As seen in the intro video (at the start of the post) when this kind of interaction is embodied by a social robot like Jibo, the experience is compelling - especially when the app/robot remembers information asserted by the user.</p>
<p>The example suggests that knowledge graphs may offer a path to take to making automated dialog significantly more human-like</p>
